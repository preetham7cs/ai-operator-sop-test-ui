# AI Operator SOP & Test Interface (Prototype)

This repository contains a single-file Streamlit prototype for the
"AI Operator SOP & Test Interface Design" assignment.

## What this demonstrates
- A clear, executable SOP for an AI Operator handling case reviews
- A simplified operator testing UI aligned exactly with the SOP
- Deterministic, testable workflow (no external APIs or LLM calls)

## How to run
```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
